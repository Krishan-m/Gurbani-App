Operating the program:
- Once you have the main.py file opened, run it
- It will prompt you to enter shabad
- Enter initial letters of every word in shabad that you want to find
- If shabad found, it will show you all the possible matches
- Select the shabad number that you want.
- Finally, it will print the selected shabad.

----------------------------------------------------

New Operating Procedures with voice search:
- Once you have the main.py file opened, run it
